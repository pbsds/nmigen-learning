# This thing

This is me playing around with my new Icebreaker FPGA with nmigen(_dg).
The goal is to find a nice project structure and perhaps find a way to work on my Arty a7 with a FOSS toolchain.

# try it:

	poetry run python -m fpga.icebreaker
	poetry run python -m fpga.modules.blinker generate
